Fluid dynamics benchmark problems
----------------------------------


The cases for these benchmarks come from NASA's
`Turbulence Modeling Resource. <https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov>`_
These cases span a wide range of RANS turbulence models and applies them to a
wide range of geometries.  They serve as a useful verification exercise and
reference cases.  Currently, the implemented models are:
